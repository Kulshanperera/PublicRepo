<h5 id="citi">Citizenship Law
</h5>
<HR>
<b id="cbefore">Before independence
</b><br>
<br>Before independence, every person born within the dominions and allegiance of the British Crown (and no other) was a British subject. Like wise native Ceylonese too was considered as British subjects. In some laws, enacted in pre independence era, they were being mentioned as native inhabitants, or otherwise natives of Ceylon. Meanwhile the Indians were mentioned as natives of India or otherwise natives of British India in the same laws.

<br>
<b>Naturalization ordinance no 21 of 1890
</b><br>There was no citizenship law in force at that time. But only the naturalization ordinance no 21 of 1890 was in force regards to the provisions for the naturalization of aliens. Under this law any alien who was actually residing in Ceylon could apply to the governor for rights and privileges as a British subject.  This law was repealed by the citizenship act no 18 of 1948.
<br><br>

<b id="cafter">After independence
<br>
</b>
<br>
<b>Citizenship act no 18 of 1948
</b>
<br>
Citizenship act was enacted to make provision for citizenship of Ceylon and for matters connected therewith and came into operation with effect from 15 November 1948 (appointed date). By this law established a status known as ‘the status of a citizen of Ceylon’ which status a person owns in one of two ways only viz. by right of descent as provided by the act or by virtue of registration as provided by the act or by any other act authorizing the grant of such status by registration.
Provisions were made by this law on, citizenship by descent, citizenship by registration, and loss of citizenship, initially. Later it was amended at several occasions, by Amendment Acts, no 40 of 1950, no 13 of 1955, no 45 of 1987, no 15 of 1993, no 43 of 1993, and no 16 of 2003, respectively.
Significant changes made by these amendments were as follows.
Provisions were made on resumption of citizenship and restriction on dual citizenship by the Act no 40 of 1950.
With the Amendment of Act no 45 of 1987, grant of Dual Citizenship provisions was commenced.
Registration as citizens, of persons registered in a resident guest scheme, under part III of immigrants and emigrants act, was provided by the Act no 43 of 1993.
Earlier the right of citizenship by descent was limited only to the paternal descent. With the enactment of the Amendment Act no 16 of 2003 it was extended even to the maternal descent with effect from the appointed date (1948-11-15) of the citizenship act.



<br>
<b>Citizenship Division
</b>
<br>Citizenship division of the Ministry of Defense under the Citizenship Act No.18 of 1948 was transferred later on to the Immigration Department. Accordingly activities of the Department expanded.
<br>
<b>Indian and Pakistani Residents Citizenship Act no 3 of 1949.
</b>
<br>Shortly after the enactment of citizenship act no 18 of 1948, the Indian and Pakistani residents’ citizenship bill was
 introduced. This was considered urgent and the Parliament passed the Indian and Pakistani residents Citizenship Act no; 3 of 1949 and came i
 nto operation on 5 august 1949. The Department for registration of Indian and Pakistani residents was set up, to implement the provisions of the act and Mr
 . V. L. Wirasinha was appointed the first commissioner, in addition to his holding the post of commissioner of parliamentary elections. Later this 
 department was affiliated to the department of immigration and emigration. The attitude of Ceylon, towards the non Ceylonese in the country, who was
  genuinely desirous of merging with Ceylonese, is indicated in the provisions of this act. Under section 3 of this act, an Indian or Pakistani who had uninterrupted residence in Ceylon immediately prior to the 
  1st day of January, 1946, for a period of ten years in case of an unmarried person or a divorcee, or seven years in case of a married person, and
   had uninterrupted residence in Ceylon from that day to the date of the application, could apply for registration as a citizen and be so registered 
   if he could satisfy the commissioners that he had lawful means of livelihood. 134,306 Indians and Pakistanis were issued with Ceylon Citizenship Certificates under the provisions of this Act. It was amended twice, by the Amendment Acts no 37 of 1950 and no 45 of 1952, respectively. Operation of this act came to end in 1962.
